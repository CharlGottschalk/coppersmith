## Overview

CopperSmith is a very simple static site builder that uses markdown files, primarily built for myself to quickly roll out documentation (default theme).

Using simple commands, you can quickly scaffold your site leaving you to simply edit the content of your pages.

Once built, the site can be hosted anywhere static HTML content is supported, like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It's perfect for shared hosting and systems where you don't have account privileges.
